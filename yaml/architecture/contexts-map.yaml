- AI Workspace uses an ACL for integrating with Templates to transform legacy templates
  into updated prompt DSLs.
- Investor uses an ACL to read Billing and Projects KPIs in aggregate form.
- Support uses an ACL for Engagements and Clients to surface limited context for ticket
  resolution.

- Notifications conforms to the data model provided by upstream event emitters (e.g.,
  InvoiceGenerated, ModelExecutionCompleted).
- Enablement conforms to the formats and metadata provided by Templates.
- Marketing Site conforms to Marketplace schemas for rendering vendor/integration
  data.
- This context map supports a service-oriented architecture with clear bounded context
  ownership and integration contracts.
