- This document defines the guiding architectural principles that govern the design,
  evolution, and operation of the AIC AI Platform. These principles ensure a scalable,
  secure, composable system aligned with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), MACH architecture,
  and cloud-native best practices.

- ''
- '- **Bounded Contexts:** Each domain is implemented and deployed independently to
  minimize coupling.'
- '- **Ubiquitous Language:** Shared vocabulary between code, documentation, and domain
  experts.'
- '- **Strategic Design:** Clear upstream/downstream relationships and context maps.'
- '- **Event-First Thinking:** Domain Events capture business state transitions for
  traceability and reactive architectures.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Single Source of Truth:** All apps, services, packages, and shared utilities
  live in one well-structured monorepo.'
- '- **Tight CI/CD Integration:** Build pipelines, versioning, and dependency management
  powered by `turbo`, `pnpm`, and `changesets`.'
- '- **Tooling as First-Class:** Scripts, generators, and infrastructure definitions
  live alongside code and follow the same standards.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Ports and Adapters:** Business logic is isolated from frameworks, databases,
  and delivery mechanisms.'
- '- **Inversion of Control:** Interfaces and dependency injection allow decoupling
  and testability.'
- '- **Independent Evolvability:** Infrastructure can change without impacting core
  logic.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Separation of Concerns:** Commands change state, queries read state.'
- '- **Immutable Event Logs:** Events represent the source of truth; state is derived
  via projections.'
- '- **Replayable & Auditable:** Full state reconstruction is possible via event replay.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Microservices:** Independently deployed services organized around business
  domains.'
- '- **API-First:** All external interactions are contract-driven and discoverable.'
- '- **Cloud-Native:** Kubernetes, containers, declarative infra (Terraform, Helm).'
- '- **Headless:** Frontends communicate via GraphQL or REST APIs; UI and backend
  evolve independently.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Async Communication:** Services emit and subscribe to events to decouple interactions.'
- '- **Domain Events:** Emitted from aggregates and consumed by sagas, policies, or
  other services.'
- '- **Event Bus:** Central broker with clear schema versioning and replay capabilities.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Extensible Modules:** Features are built as plug-in services or packages.'
- '- **Shared Interfaces:** APIs, packages, and schemas are reused across apps and
  services.'
- '- **Marketplace-Ready:** Vendors can publish extensions that integrate natively
  into the platform.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Structured Logging:** All logs are queryable and correlated by trace IDs.'
- '- **Distributed Tracing:** Across apps and services for root cause analysis.'
- '- **Health Probes:** Readiness and liveness endpoints for orchestration.'
- '- **Infrastructure as Code:** All environments (dev, staging, prod) are reproducible
  and auditable.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Zero Trust:** Every service and user must authenticate and be authorized.'
- '- **Defense in Depth:** Layered controls across app, infra, network, and CI/CD
  layers.'
- '- **Immutable Deployments:** Builds are reproducible and verified.'
- '- **Least Privilege:** Every component operates with minimal required permissions.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **CLI Scaffolding:** All domains, services, packages, and events are generated
  using tools.'
- '- **Versioned Events & APIs:** All breaking changes require explicit versioning.'
- '- **ADR-Driven Change:** Architectural decisions are logged and reviewed in `docs/architecture/adr/`.'
- ''
- '---'
- ''
- ''
- '- **Tech Radar:** New technologies must pass ADRs and pilot tests.'
- '- **Policy-Driven Dev:** Linting, commit conventions, and CI checks enforce standards.'
- '- **Tenant-Aware:** All platform capabilities respect multi-tenancy boundaries
  and constraints.'

- '- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate models for writes
  and reads'

  events'
