# Security Requirements

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security principles, protocols, and operational guidelines for the AIC AI Platform. Security is foundational to the platform's design, given its multi-tenant nature, integration with external apps, and role-based user access. All components of the system—apps, services, packages, data stores, and infrastructure—must conform to strict security protocols for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

## 2. Security Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** Trust no network, user, or system by default.
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls across zones.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Grant only the minimum access required.
- **Encryption Everywhere:** Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
- **Auditability:** All actions must be observable and logged.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### 3.1 Identity Management

- **SSO Support** via OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for all user-facing apps.
- **Tenant Isolation** at authentication and session layers.
- **Session Management** with time-based expiration and refresh tokens.

### 3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role          | Scope                  |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Admin         | Global system access    |
| Consultant    | Internal service access |
| Client User   | Tenant-scoped features  |
| Developer     | Scoped APIs, sandboxes  |
| Vendor        | Marketplace management  |
| Support       | Customer support tools  |
| Investor      | Read-only VDR, KPIs     |

Access rules are codified and enforced across frontend guards, API layers, and services using centralized policies.

---

## 4. Data Security

### 4.1 Encryption

- **At Rest:** All databases and S3 buckets encrypted (AES-256).
- **In Transit:** All internal and external communication over TLS 1.2+.
- **Secrets:** Stored in KMS or Vault with role-based retrieval.

### 4.2 Tenant Isolation

- Per-tenant DB schemas or row-level security.
- Strong namespace segmentation for events and logs.
- Prohibited cross-tenant access by design.

---

## 5. Infrastructure Security

### 5.1 Containerization & Runtime

- All services deployed via containers (Docker) in Kubernetes.
- Images scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) during CI.
- Resource limits and seccomp profiles applied to all pods.

### 5.2 Network

- Internal services segmented with NetworkPolicies.
- Egress/Ingress controlled via service mesh or gateway (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).
- API Gateways enforce auth, rate-limiting, and IP whitelisting.

---

## 6. Development & DevSecOps

### 6.1 Secure SDLC

- Code review for all PRs with security checklist.
- Dependencies audited with Renovate + Changesets.
- Static analysis with ESLint, SonarQube, or Semgrep.
- Pre-commit and CI secrets scanning.

### 6.2 CI/CD Pipeline Hardening

- GitHub Actions with limited secrets scope.
- Token rotation policies enforced.
- Builds verified with checksums/signatures.
- Only signed commits allowed on `main`.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Response

- Audit logs persisted for all auth, data access, and mutations.
- Alerting pipelines on suspicious patterns.
- Rate-limiting and IP blocking after brute-force attempts.
- SIEM integration optional for enterprise clients.

---

## 8. Compliance

- NDA-enforced access policies.
- SOC 2 alignment (Type I in short-term, Type II roadmap).
- GDPR-ready data deletion and export features.
- Access review automation for all privileged accounts.

---

## 9. Incident Response Plan

| Phase     | Response Details |
|-----------|------------------|
| Detection | Alerts from monitoring, logs, anomaly detection |
| Containment | Lock accounts, revoke tokens, isolate pods |
| Investigation | Analyze logs, audit trails, snapshots |
| Recovery | Rollback deployments, reset credentials |
| Notification | Stakeholders informed within SLA (24h max) |
