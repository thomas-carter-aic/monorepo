# Architecture Principles

This document defines the guiding architectural principles that govern the design, evolution, and operation of the AIC AI Platform. These principles ensure a scalable, secure, composable system aligned with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), MACH architecture, and cloud-native best practices.

---

## 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Bounded Contexts:** Each domain is implemented and deployed independently to minimize coupling.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Shared vocabulary between code, documentation, and domain experts.
- **Strategic Design:** Clear upstream/downstream relationships and context maps.
- **Event-First Thinking:** Domain Events capture business state transitions for traceability and reactive architectures.

---

## 2. Modular Monorepo

- **Single Source of Truth:** All apps, services, packages, and shared utilities live in one well-structured monorepo.
- **Tight CI/CD Integration:** Build pipelines, versioning, and dependency management powered by `turbo`, `pnpm`, and `changesets`.
- **Tooling as First-Class:** Scripts, generators, and infrastructure definitions live alongside code and follow the same standards.

---

## 3. Clean/Hexagonal Architecture

- **Ports and Adapters:** Business logic is isolated from frameworks, databases, and delivery mechanisms.
- **Inversion of Control:** Interfaces and dependency injection allow decoupling and testability.
- **Independent Evolvability:** Infrastructure can change without impacting core logic.

---

## 4. CQRS + Event Sourcing

- **Separation of Concerns:** Commands change state, queries read state.
- **Immutable Event Logs:** Events represent the source of truth; state is derived via projections.
- **Replayable & Auditable:** Full state reconstruction is possible via event replay.

---

## 5. MACH Architecture

- **Microservices:** Independently deployed services organized around business domains.
- **API-First:** All external interactions are contract-driven and discoverable.
- **Cloud-Native:** Kubernetes, containers, declarative infra (Terraform, Helm).
- **Headless:** Frontends communicate via GraphQL or REST APIs; UI and backend evolve independently.

---

## 6. Event-Driven Systems

- **Async Communication:** Services emit and subscribe to events to decouple interactions.
- **Domain Events:** Emitted from aggregates and consumed by sagas, policies, or other services.
- **Event Bus:** Central broker with clear schema versioning and replay capabilities.

---

## 7. Composability

- **Extensible Modules:** Features are built as plug-in services or packages.
- **Shared Interfaces:** APIs, packages, and schemas are reused across apps and services.
- **Marketplace-Ready:** Vendors can publish extensions that integrate natively into the platform.

---

## 8. Observability & Operations

- **Structured Logging:** All logs are queryable and correlated by trace IDs.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Across apps and services for root cause analysis.
- **Health Probes:** Readiness and liveness endpoints for orchestration.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All environments (dev, staging, prod) are reproducible and auditable.

---

## 9. Security by Design

- **Zero Trust:** Every service and user must authenticate and be authorized.
- **Defense in Depth:** Layered controls across app, infra, network, and CI/CD layers.
- **Immutable Deployments:** Builds are reproducible and verified.
- **Least Privilege:** Every component operates with minimal required permissions.

---

## 10. Evolvability & Automation

- **CLI Scaffolding:** All domains, services, packages, and events are generated using tools.
- **Versioned Events & APIs:** All breaking changes require explicit versioning.
- **ADR-Driven Change:** Architectural decisions are logged and reviewed in `docs/architecture/adr/`.

---

## 11. Platform Governance

- **Tech Radar:** New technologies must pass ADRs and pilot tests.
- **Policy-Driven Dev:** Linting, commit conventions, and CI checks enforce standards.
- **Tenant-Aware:** All platform capabilities respect multi-tenancy boundaries and constraints.

## 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Organize software around **business capabilities** and **bounded contexts**
- Ubiquitous Language must be reflected in code and documentation
- Favor aggregates, value objects, domain services, and entities within services

---

## 2. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

- Every service must expose external interfaces via clearly defined **ports**
- Infrastructure dependencies (databases, queues, APIs) are injected as **adapters**
- Business logic must be isolated from delivery and transport layers

---

## 3. Microservices

- Services are independently deployable, testable, and loosely coupled
- Bounded contexts are implemented as services aligned with subdomains
- Internal contracts use domain events; external contracts use stable APIs

---

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture

- All state changes are modeled as domain events
- Events are immutable, durable, and broadcast asynchronously
- Services subscribe to events using the event bus (e.g., NATS, Kafka)

---

## 5. CQRS & Event Sourcing

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate models for writes and reads
- **Event Sourcing**: The system state is rebuilt by replaying a sequence of domain events
- Enables auditability, debugging, and time-travel features

---

## 6. MACH Principles

**M**icroservices — Each service encapsulates a business capability  
**A**PI-first — All capabilities are exposed via versioned contracts  
**C**loud-native — The platform is containerized and orchestrated (e.g., Kubernetes)  
**H**eadless — Frontends consume data via APIs and events

---

## 7. Composability

- Capabilities (e.g., auth, payments, workflows) are exposed as pluggable modules
- Marketplace enables third-party extensions, apps, and automations
- Clients can compose their own dashboards, automations, and model pipelines

---

## 8. Modularity

- Clear module boundaries with encapsulated responsibilities
- Shared packages (e.g., `domain-events`, `event-bus`, `auth-client`) are versioned and reused
- Cross-cutting concerns like logging, tracing, and config are standardized in packages

---

## 9. Scalability

- Services must be horizontally scalable
- Stateless interfaces are preferred
- Backpressure and retries must be built into consumers and APIs

---

## 10. Security-by-Design

- All APIs require authentication and granular authorization
- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Audit logs are required for all tenant-sensitive operations

---

## 11. Observability

- Platform must support distributed tracing, structured logging, and metrics
- All events and API requests must include trace and correlation IDs
- Dashboards must monitor latency, errors, throughput, and saturation

---

## 12. Automation-First

- All actions should be automatable via CLI, CI/CD pipelines, or APIs
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the default (Terraform, Helm, GitOps)
- Environment bootstrap, provisioning, teardown are fully scriptable

---

## 13. Self-Service Enablement

- Tenants, developers, and vendors must be empowered through:
  - Self-service onboarding
  - CLI tooling and templates
  - Sandbox environments
  - Developer documentation and event catalogs

---

## 14. Platform Thinking

- Treat the AI PaaS as a product for both internal and external users
- Ensure extensibility, upgrade paths, and guardrails
- Adopt product-level monitoring, usage insights, and lifecycle ownership

---

## 15. Continuous Improvement

- All major decisions must be captured via Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Regular architectural reviews and refactoring are required
- Feedback loops must exist between platform, product, and engineering
