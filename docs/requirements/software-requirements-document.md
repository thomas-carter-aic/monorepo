# Software Requirements Document (SRD)

**System Title**: AIC AI Platform — Multi-Tenant AI Consulting and Enablement Suite  
**Author**: Applied Innovation Corporation (AIC)  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: July 2025

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the functional, non-functional, operational, and architectural requirements for the AIC AI Platform — a secure, composable, multi-tenant system for delivering AI consulting, enablement, and transformation to SMB and enterprise clients. It consolidates insights across security, architecture, DevOps, SDLC, and user experience to act as a single source of truth.

## 2. Scope

The AIC AI Platform supports:

- AI consulting engagements and delivery workflows
- An AI Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for client-facing teams
- Internal tooling for consultants, support, and operations
- Developer tools, SDKs, and marketplaces for third parties
- Administrative systems for managing users, tenants, apps, and infrastructure
- Investor reporting and VDR access
- Multi-portal frontend architecture aligned with MACH principles

---

## 6. Technical Constraints

- Monorepo managed via [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build)
- Multi-language microservices (Node.js, Go, Python, Java)
- Kubernetes (EKS), Helm, Terraform-managed infrastructure
- Event-driven via message broker (NATS or Kafka)
- Persistent storage: PostgreSQL, S3, Redis
- Secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager / Vault

---

## 7. Software Interfaces

| Interface           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **REST APIs**       | Service-specific HTTP endpoints for client & system use |
| **GraphQL APIs**    | Flexible client data querying interface |
| **Webhooks**        | Push-based integration mechanism for external systems |
| **gRPC (optional)** | Internal system-to-system high-performance APIs |
| **OpenAPI Docs**    | Generated API specifications and documentation |
| **SDKs**            | Typed clients (JS, Python, Go) provided via `api-clients` package |

---

## 8. Operational Requirements

- CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions + Turbo + Changesets)
- GitOps-based infrastructure and environment management
- Observability: metrics, traces, structured logging
- Support for multiple deployment stages: dev, staging, prod
- Rollback capabilities via Blue/Green or Canary deployments
- Live sandbox environment for external developer testing

---

## 9. Domain Events & Messaging

- All service interactions and state transitions emit domain events
- Domain events use versioned schemas with Zod validation
- Shared `event-bus` library handles publishing/subscription
- Events are persisted in a pluggable event store
- Events are replayable for projections, CQRS, and audit trails

---

## 10. System Architecture Principles

- Clean Architecture / Hexagonal: ports and adapters pattern
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): aggregates, value objects, services
- Event Sourcing + CQRS
- Bounded Contexts aligned with business domains (auth, clients, billing, support, etc.)
- Sagas and orchestrators for distributed consistency
- Modular, composable, contract-driven development

---

## 11. Security Requirements

- RBAC, API tokens, OAuth2, MFA support
- Just-in-time privilege elevation ("break glass" workflows)
- Rotation of secrets, keys, credentials on schedule
- Environment-level network segmentation
- Periodic access reviews and policy audits
- Signed and validated webhook/event payloads
- Least-privilege IAM for infrastructure access

---

## 12. Compliance & Legal

- Clients may sign NDA for internal use of AI PaaS
- Read-only access available for investors and auditors
- System supports classification and tagging of sensitive data
- License restricts distribution or commercial use without approval
