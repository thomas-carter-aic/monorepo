the system is being designed with multiple user-types in mind. 
Admin: there will be an admin (myself) which will administer the entire system,
Consultant users will be my employees, 
Client users will be individuals that work for my clients who will be  using the AI PaaS platform on behalf of my clients, 
Developer users will be my own internal developers and developers working for my clients or developers my clients have hired and/or third party developers, 
Vendor users who will be managing their own applications, extensions, integrations, etc. in our marketplace, 
Support personnel who work for me, 
possibly some others user types
There will be a business/corporate/marketing site which I will use for establishing the web presence for my consulting company as well as marketing our AI PaaS and other SaaS products. 
There will be an employee portal. 
There will be an admin portal and dashboard for administrating the system. 
There will be an investor portal with a virtual data room.  
There will be a support portal for support, helpdesk, knowledge base, ticketing, etc.
There will be a developer portal with developer specific information
Each client will have their own dashboards, profiles, and abilities to use the AI PaaS and other SaaS products they subscribe to
Thus, I need to determine the core capabilities for all these areas. There will be internal microservices that apply to the system as a whole. There will be client facing microservices. There may be some shared/common microservices.
How should/could we best approach this



Designing a system like this — with **multi-tenant, multi-role, multi-portal complexity** — calls for a structured and layered approach to defining your **core capabilities**, **bounded contexts**, and **services**. Below is a plan that combines **DDD**, **MACH principles**, and **platform product thinking** to guide you from concept to architecture.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Identify Core Capability Domains by Perspective

Let’s deconstruct by **user type and portal** to reveal underlying capabilities. These are your **bounded contexts** or domain services.

### 🧑‍💼 Internal Users

| Portal / Role    | Capabilities                                                         | Domain Context                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Admin Portal     | Tenant management, system config, app visibility, user impersonation | `admin`, `tenancy`, `users`, `audit`           |
| Employee Portal  | Task management, project visibility, internal comms                  | `projects`, `internal-tools`, `communications` |
| Support Portal   | Helpdesk, ticketing, knowledge base, live chat                       | `support`, `tickets`, `kb`, `messaging`        |
| Developer Portal | App registration, API keys, docs, SDKs, sandbox                      | `devtools`, `marketplace`, `auth`, `telemetry` |

### 👥 External Users

| Role              | Capabilities                                                 | Domain Context                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client Users      | AI workspace, model execution, dashboards, billing, settings | `clients`, `workspace`, `billing`, `models`, `data`    |
| Client Developers | Integration setup, access tokens, API docs                   | `devtools`, `auth`, `events`, `integrations`           |
| Vendors           | App submissions, analytics, support inbox, API monetization  | `marketplace`, `apps`, `vendor-portal`, `analytics`    |
| Investors         | Access to financials, reports, VDR, investor communications  | `investor-relations`, `vdr`, `legal-docs`, `analytics` |

### 📣 Marketing Site

* Lead generation
* Blog, updates
* Product landing pages
* Forms & newsletter subscriptions

Context: `marketing`, `web`, `cms`, `seo`, `leads`

---

## 🧭 Step 2: Group Capabilities into Core, Supporting, Generic Domains

| Type           | Capabilities                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core**       | AI Workspace, Model Management, Client Dashboards, Templates, Data Ingestion |
| **Supporting** | Marketplace, App Registry, Billing, Integrations, User Identity              |
| **Generic**    | Auth, Audit Logs, Webhooks, Email Delivery, Tenant Billing, Role Management  |

---

## 📁 Step 3: Monorepo Structure Recommendation (Top Level)

## 🔄 Step 4: Design the Cross-Cutting Architecture

### 🏗 Shared Core Infrastructure

| Capability      | Domain / Tooling                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-tenancy   | `tenancy/`, `clients/`                       |
| AuthN/AuthZ     | Centralized auth service (OIDC/SAML support) |
| Event Bus       | Kafka / NATS / Redis Streams                 |
| Event Store     | PostgreSQL w/ outbox or EventStoreDB         |
| CI/CD & Secrets | Terraform + Vault + ArgoCD or CircleCI       |
| Observability   | Logging, tracing, metrics                    |

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Define Domain Events for Communication

Establish a common domain event spec:

```json
{
  "type": "UserInvited",
  "context": "clients",
  "tenantId": "acme",
  "payload": {
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "developer"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "...",
    "timestamp": "...",
    "source": "admin-portal"
  }
}
```

Used for:

* CQRS projections
* Sagas (orchestration)
* Audit logging
* Triggers and workflows

---

## 📜 Step 6: Establish Ubiquitous Language

Document a `docs/ubiquitous-language.md`:

* “Workspace” = client's AI environment
* “Execution” = run of a model or pipeline
* “Integration” = third-party service connected to a client
* “Template” = reusable AI use case blueprint

Make sure your model, services, and UI reflect this language.

---

## 🔐 Step 7: Define Roles and Access Policies

Create a `services/auth/roles.ts` or RBAC model:

```ts
// user-roles.ts
export const Roles = {
  Admin: 'admin',
  Consultant: 'consultant',
  ClientUser: 'client_user',
  Developer: 'developer',
  Vendor: 'vendor',
  Support: 'support',
  Investor: 'investor'
};
```

Use policies like:

* `canImpersonateUser()`
* `canSubmitApp()`
* `canViewModelOutputs()`

And assign **scopes** or **tenants** to those roles for fine-grained access.

---

## ✅ Summary: What You Should Do Now

| Action                                         | Outcome                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Map all users → capabilities → contexts        | Your domain model & service map                  |
| Scaffold services/portals using consistent DDD | Start clean & structured                         |
| Use shared packages for eventing, auth, UI     | Enforce DRY & reusability                        |
| Codify roles and access levels                 | Secure & isolated experiences for each user type |
| Define event schema, setup event bus           | Enables event-driven, observable architecture    |
| Document all domain terms & flows              | Ensures shared understanding across your org     |

Would you like me to generate:

* A domain map markdown table?
* A scaffolding script for all user types and services?
* Role-based access model + policy definitions?

Let’s make this real and codified in your monorepo.

* **CQRS**: Split read models (dashboards, logs, analytics) from write models (commands, mutations).
* **Event Sourcing**: Persist business facts as events, derive current state.
* **Saga Patterns**: Implement orchestration/choreography for long-running workflows (e.g., onboarding).
* **MACH**: Modular, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless principles enforced across the stack.
